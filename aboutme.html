				<p>
					I'm Eric, a results-driven mechanical engineer with a lifelong passion for the integration of
					engineering and computer science. My journey began with a fascination for taking things apart to
					understand how they work, and that curiosity has led me to explore the exciting intersection of

					mechanical engineering and artificial intelligence. After delving into prompt engineering and
					agentic AI, I've realized the immense potential of these technologies and their transformative
					impact on the future of engineering.
				</p>
				<p>
					My mechanical engineering background provides me with a strong foundation in design, analysis, and
					manufacturing. Proficient in SolidWorks, I leverage FEA to optimize designs and ensure performance.
					My hands-on experience includes 3D printing, laser cutting (gained during my time at Mechanismic
					Inc.), and CNC machining (from my coursework). I've completed all core mechanical engineering
					coursework and am currently preparing for the FE exam. You can explore some of my mechanical
					projects in my <a href="mechanical.html">Mechanical Portfolio Link</a>.
				</p>
				<p>
					Complementing my mechanical skills, I'm actively developing my expertise in software engineering,
					particularly in areas relevant to AI and robotics. I've worked on data analysis and machine learning
					projects using Python and have developed Node.js applications that integrate with ChatGPT. My
					projects, including those related to agentic AI, are available in my <a href="software.html">Software Portfolio Link</a>. 
				</p>
				<p>

					<span class="image right"><img src="images/aboutme/rocketteam.jpg" alt="" /></span>
					I'm particularly passionate about the application of machine
					learning in engineering. I see tremendous opportunity in combining these fields to create intelligent
					and adaptable systems. This passion fuels my involvement in extracurricular activities, such as
					hosting the 2024 SBUHacks hackathon at my university and contributing to the SBU Rocket Team's
					participation in the NASA Student Launch competition. These experiences have not only honed my
					technical skills but also cultivated my leadership abilities. I'm a natural leader who values
					listening to others, readily takes responsibility, and thrives in collaborative environments.
				</p>
				<p>
					My career goal is to specialize in machine learning for engineering applications. I aspire to
					leadership roles where I can contribute to innovation and inspire others. I am currently seeking
					full-time opportunities where I can apply my skills and passion to challenging and impactful
					projects.
