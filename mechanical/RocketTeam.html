				<h2>Problem</h2>
				<p><b>Altitude Precision: </b> Achieve the declared altitude of 5,000 feet while maintaining a stable flight
					profile. <br />
					<b>Payload Integration: </b> Safely transport the STEMNaut payload and gather quality telemetry data
					throughout the flight. <br />
					<b>Competition Requirements: </b> Comply with NASA's guidelines for scoring, which include rocket design,
					report quality, data accuracy, and altitude achievement.
				</p>
				<p><span class="image fit"><img src="../images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>

				<h2>Technology Used</h2>
				<p><b>RockSim: </b> Modeled the rocket's performance and validated stability margins through iterative flight
					simulations. <br />
					<b>3D Printing:</b> Fabricated custom components for electronics mounts and the STEMNaut payload to reduce
					weight and streamline assembly. <br />
					<b>Machine Shop & Power Tools:</b> Constructed subscale rocket sections and fins under strict safety
					protocols; handled propellants with licensed professionals.
				</p>
				
				<h2>What I learned:</h2>
				<p><b>Leadership & Decision-Making: </b> When the subscale rocket build stalled due to indecision, I took the
					initiative to finalize design choices and push the project forward. This experience taught me the importance of
					stepping up as a leader while balancing input from teammates. <br />
					<b>Risk Management & Adaptability Under Pressure: </b> When a critical design near-miss with the fins
					threatened the subscale rocket's stability, we had just two days before launch—no time to remake parts. I led a
					rapid, high-stakes assessment of the compromised stability margin, carefully balancing the risks of flying with
					imperfect fins against the time and materials constraints. Despite a slight wobble in flight, the subscale launched
					successfully, reinforcing the importance of thorough risk evaluation, decisive leadership under pressure, and the
					willingness to adapt plans on tight timelines. <br />
					<b>Collaboration & Communication: </b> Working with NASA specialists, faculty advisors, and a large, diverse
					team helped me develop stronger communication skills. I learned to clearly articulate design rationale and listen
					to concerns from colleagues.
				</p>

				<h2>Looking ahead:</h2>
				<p><b>Further Stabilization: </b> Refine fin design and overall stability margin for the full-scale launch in
					May. <br />
					<b>Enhanced Team Dynamics: </b> Establish clearer accountability and leadership structures to avoid delays.<br />
					<b>Data Integration: </b> Improve telemetry systems for real-time tracking and post-flight analysis.
				</p>

				<h2>Final Note:</h2>
				<p>The full-scale rocket is scheduled for launch in May in Alabama, where we will demonstrate the final
					design's performance and collect comprehensive flight data. This project has already provided invaluable
					hands-on experience in aerospace engineering, team leadership, and practical manufacturing processes—skills that I
					intend to carry forward in future endeavors.
