## Projects

### [Chef Buddy](https://github.com/sixym3/chefbuddy-frontend)
**Description:** This project was inspired while I was taking a course on "Prompt Engineering for AI". While learning to engineer prompts for AI, I realized I could build an app that manages recipes and uses AI to generate recipes. Hence, Chef Buddy was born, a AI powered recipe manager that allows you to search for recipes, plan your meals, and suggest recipes based on your pantry items and taste!
